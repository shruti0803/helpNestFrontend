# Helpnest

HelpNest is the platform for health, independence and everyday support.  It is designed for elders living alone—to manage and purchase medicines, track their health and appointments, and connect with reliable, trained helpers. It brings together all the help they might need in one place—from daily tasks to medicine reminders, safety support, and trusted companions—helping them stay safe, confident, and connected to their community.
